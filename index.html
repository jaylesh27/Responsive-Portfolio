		<p>
			Welcome to my (nascent) website!  My name is Jaylesh Patel, but call me Jay for short.  I am an aspiring full-stack web developer and am currently enrolled in the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp.  If you're interested in my "origin story", then here it is:  I graduated from Rutgers Business School in 2013 with degrees in finance and supply chain management.  After a few years in the supply chain field, I decided to change careers and pursue a long-held interest of mine: coding!
		</p>
		<p>
			Apart from coding, I do have other interests.  I enjoy hiking, running, reading, keeping up to date with events in both politics and tech, and travelling.  I've been to quite a few countries already (the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Malaysia, India, Singapore...to name a few).
